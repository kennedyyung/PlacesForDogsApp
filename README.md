## Places to bring dogs

## What is this application?
This application that I have created is intended to be a way for other dog owners (or other pets) like myself to be able to keep track 
of places that we can bring our pets. This application allows the user to form lists of location types, and fill those 
with locations in which they can or can't bring their pets. The user may form the location lists and locations inputting 
their addresses, as well as being able to add comments and a rating to each location that they can view later on.
