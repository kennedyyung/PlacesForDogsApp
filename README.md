## Places to bring dogs

## What is this application?
This application that I have created is intended to be a way for other dog owners like myself to be able to keep track 
of places that we can bring our pets. This application allows the user to form lists of location types, and fill those 
with locations in which they can or can't bring their pets. The user may form the location lists and locations inputting 
their addresses, as well as being able to add comments and a rating to each location that they can view later on. 

## User Stories
implemented user stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add different locations to a list
- As a user, I want to be able to have different lists for different types of locations
- As a user, I want to be able to select a place and see all the information on it
- As a user, I want to be able to select a place and add multiple comments
- As a user, I want to be able to select a place and rate it out of 10
- As a user, I want to be able to save all my lists and information when I quit the application
- As a user, I want to be able to continue adding information/locations to already made lists
