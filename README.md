## Places to bring dogs


The application that I am planning on doing will be a type of tracker for different places that one can bring their dog.
This application would have sub sections to easily differenciate  type of places. The user would log in to location 
names, the working hours, any restrictions for the pets, if it is inside or outside,  and would be able to rate and 
leave comments/points for each place. In the application I also plan on having some sort of search tool to be able to 
search what places are open at a certain time.

Examples of types of places the application could include:
- Restaurants
- Parks
- Stores
- Malls


## User Stories
implemented user stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add different locations to a list
- As a user, I want to be able to have different lists for different types of locations
- As a user, I want to be able to select a place and see all the information on it
- As a user, I want to be able to select a place and add multiple comments
- As a user, I want to be able to select a place and rate it out of 10
- As a user, I want to be able to save all my lists and information when I quit the application
- As a user, I want to be able to continue adding information/locations to already made lists

## Instructions for Grader
- You can generate the first required event related to adding X's and Y by inputting a location list name in the
  textfield in the opening panel
- you can generate the second required event related to adding X's to a Y by clicking the "New Location" button at the 
  bottom of the screen and then fill in the fields and select the location list you want to add to then click the 
  "set location" button. This adds the location you created into the location list you recently created


  (another event) 
- if you select the "view location lists" button at the bottom you can now double click the location list you want to
  view, and then the list of locations will show in the next column. From there you can double click a location you want
  more information on which will then be displayed in the next column


- You can locate my visual component by clicking the "set location" button in the "New location" panel. The image will
  appear every time a new location is added
- You can save the state of my application by clicking the "Save current lists" button at the bottom of the application
- You can reload the state of my application by clicking the "Load lists" button at the bottom of the application

(Side note):
the comments and rating textfield and combo box currently do not have a function and are just displayed

## Phase 4: Task 3
- I would like to work more on the visual presentation of my application and change the formatting and how certain
lists/values are displayed
- I would like to refactor some methods in my classes as I believe they could be more simple and neater written
- I would like to add some exceptions as there are multiple methods where I check if it is an integer so the exception 
would help reduce the redundancy of my code
- I also would like to add exceptions to check if the user inputs the information in the right format
- I would like to add some more methods to shorten method length of overlapping methods within the gui
